Test YOUR Knowledge:

1) Question int Divide by Zero

int a = 10;
int b = a / 0;

Console.WriteLine($"{b}");

Ans: Divide by zero exception: attempt to divide by zero

2) Double divide by zero  i am getting infinity

3) When you overflow an int varialbe it just goes to the other
end like for example int.maxvalue+1 will become int.minvalue

4) y++ is a post increment, meaning it assigns the value then 
it increments.
++y is a pre increment meaning it will increment first before 
assigning the value to any other varialbe.

5) Continue will continue the loop and wont execute the next steps
meaning it will go and increment itself instead of executing the rest
of the loop at that point.

Break will break out of the loop to go to the next statements.

return it ends the method so the loop wont complete if in the middle
we return it will break out and end the loop as well.

6) The three parts of a for loop are initialization, condition and increment
or update
So nothing is mandatory among these but the mandatory are the semicolons
;; we need to add the two semicolons doesn't matter if we are adding anything 
or not..

7) '=' is an assigning operator it assigns the value on the right to the left
	'==' is an equality checker it return true or false based on the 
	result.

8) Yes for(;true;); just runs and in a infinite loop. 

9) _ is like a default switch case, if the input does not match anty case
then we use _ like a backup output

10) IEnumerable is the interface to be implemented by an object so it can be
used in a foreach loop
